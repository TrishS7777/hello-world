This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
Something about me.  I'm a female and very excited about learning to code.  I've had various computer classes over the years, now I'm ready to go all in on coding.  I'm very interested in AI and helping shape the future.  I've also been a (para)mutuel clerk (teller) at the Thoroughbred Race tracks in Kentucky and also a few other tracks in the north (Pimlico, Belmont and the Little Brown Jug at the Fair Grounds in Delaware, OH).  It is great fun and that is why I have continued to do it.  It is seasonal, however.
